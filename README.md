# Installing wkhtmltopdf

The latest release of `wkhtmltopdf` is hella buggy. The last stable release
(0.9.9) can be installed with homebrew:

- Run `brew versions wkhtmltopdf` to find the short sha of the 0.9.9 version
  of wkhtmltopdf.
- `cd /usr/local` and use the git command from the previous step
- `brew install wkhtmltopdf`
